Key Points:
1. The main loop handles user input and agent interactions.
2. Agent message processing is the core of the system, utilizing various components.
3. The prompt system and language model integration are crucial for generating responses.
4. Tools are executed based on the agent's decisions, with special attention to their output.
5. Memory management ensures efficient storage and retrieval of information.
6. The system supports multi-agent interactions through subordinate agent calls.
7. Error handling is implemented throughout the process for robustness.

This diagram illustrates the flow of information and control in the Agent-Zero system, highlighting the importance of tool execution and their outputs in the overall process.
